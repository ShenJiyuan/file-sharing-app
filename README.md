# file-sharing-app
This directory includes two applications for file-sharing. 'tcp' directory are codes implementing the tcp protocol for file sharing between two hosts. 'udp+rdt3.0' directory are codes implementing unreliable udp protocol plus reliable tricks that rdt3.0 defines for file sharing between two hosts. Both reports are really detailed and codes are well-readable.
